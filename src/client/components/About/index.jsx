    <h4 className="demo-title">About Us</h4>
    <h6 className="aboutUs-text">
      Samorpan is a collection of youth across all walks of life. Our collective aim is
to be of support and service to our parents and all elderly people around us.
We understand that every parent wants to see their children happy and
successful. In our endeavour to be successful, often we move out to faraway
places and we cannot be physically present with our parents. No matter how
much we want them to be happy and enjoy a comfortable life, we are often
caught in the dilemma as to how to balance our corporate life with our parents
retired life. The gap is ever widening and leads to stress on both sides. This is
where SAMORAPN comes in the picture. Our objective is to bridge the gap. We
are remote control in your hands. Allow us to do what you want to do for your
parents or loved ones. You are the soul, we will be the body.
Our collective effort is to erase the concept of an old age home. We hate that.
We hate the fact that a person works the entire life, creates his own world and
just because s/he is old and unable to do certain things, he has to leave his
world and go to an old age home, where he is an alien, and then starts
readjustments in life. We want to abolish that. Be yourself, we are there with
you, in any and every walks of life. We will try to fulfil all your wishes, because
you have done that for us.
